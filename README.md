## Live Project
🌐 **Live Site:** https://louiseka.github.io/colour-scheme/

## What is the Colour Scheme Picker?
**Colour Scheme Picker** is a web application that generates a palette of **five colours** using **The Color API**.

Users can select a base colour and choose a colour scheme from a dropdown menu to generate a matching colour palette based on their selection.

This project focuses on API integration, user input handling, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.

## Features
- Select a base colour using a colour picker
- Choose from multiple colour scheme options
- Generate a palette of five colours
- Fetch colour data from **The Color API**
- Dynamically update the UI with generated palettes

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure and markup
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Application logic, API calls, and DOM manipulation

### JavaScript Concepts Practiced
- Event listeners to respond to user input
- `fetch()` for retrieving data from The Color API
- DOM manipulation to render colour palettes dynamically

## Future Improvements
- Default the colour picker to **hex** values
- Allow users to **copy hex codes** by clicking on them
- Improve mobile responsiveness by displaying the palette **horizontally**
