# Colour Scheme Picker

## Description

I've created a Colour Scheme Picker using 'The Color API.' Users can select a colour and a colour scheme from a dropdown menu to generate a palette of five colours based on the chosen scheme.

### Technologies used

I have used JavaScript for this project, because:

- I can use event listeners to respond to user's inputs
- Able to use fetch() to retrieve data from The Color API efficiently.
- Able to manipulate the DOM to display the generated palettes.

## Implementations for the future

- Defaulted to hex for the colour picker
- Ability to copy the generated hex codes by clicking them
- Update mobile responsiveness - make the palette appear horizontally
